# Virtual-Backpack
A one stop app for all your school needs. Write down notes, Schedule events, write down your to-do list, quiz yourself with flashcards and upload your ID for convenience. We have it all here in your virtual-backpack. 

You can access the app itself using this link https://gh0sty23.github.io/virtual-backpack-site/

Created by students from Mapua for a school project.
